Trigonometry Problem Set
========================

- Convert the following angles from degress to radians: 45°, −27° and 120°
- Convert the following angles from radians to degrees: 1r, .32r, 7r
- An airplane is flying at an altitude of 6000m over the ocean directly toward a coastline. At a certain time, the angle of depression to the coastline from the airplane is 14°. How much farther does the airplane have to fly before it is directly above the coastline?
- From a horizontal distance of 80.0m, the angle of elevation to the top of a flagpole is 18°. Calculate the height of the flagpole to the nearest tenth of a metre.
- A 9.0m ladder rests against the side of a wall. The bottom of the ladder is 1.5 m from the base of the wall. Determine the measure of the angle between the ladder and the ground.
- The angle of elevation of the sun is 68° when a tree casts a shadow 14.3 m long. How tall is the tree?
- A wheelchair ramp is 4.2m long. It rises 0.7m. What is its angle of inclination to the nearest
degree?
- A person flying a kite has released 176m of string. The string makes an angle of 27° with the
ground. How high is the kite? How far away is the kite horizontally? 
- A kite flies over a fence and starts to descend. The person holding the
string attached to the kite is holding it one meter above the ground. The
fence is two meters high at a distance of 4m from the person. At the
instant the kite touches the fence, there is 3m of string between the
kite and the fence. At that instant, how high off the ground is the kite?
- A wheel has a radius of 28 inches. It turns through an angle of 1.2r.
How far does a point on the rim travel during the turn?
- A door measures 90cm from the hinge to the outer edge. It swings through
an angle of 1.4r. How far does the outer edge travel?

And this crazy trigonometry problem
-----------------------------------
- A character in a computer game is represented by an equilateral triange (all sides are the same length). The length of each of the sides is 20 units. The centre of the character is positioned at position (100, 150) and pointing straight up. What are the coordinates of the vertices of the triangle?
- There is another character located at (400, 135). What angle would the first character need to rotate by in order to face the second character?
- What is the new position of the vertices after the rotation?
